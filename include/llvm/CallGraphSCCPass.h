// This file defines the CallGraphSCCPass class, which is used for passes which
// are implemented as bottom-up traversals on the call graph.  Because there may
// be cycles in the call graph, passes of this type operate on the call-graph in
// SCC order: that is, they process function bottom-up, except for recursive
// functions, which they process all at once.
//
// These passes are inherently interprocedural, and are required to keep the
// call graph up-to-date if they do anything which could modify it.
